# odin-etch-a-sketch
Interactive drawing board based on a grid of squares.

The program is based on a grid that is generated in a container of a pre-set size.

The number of cells in the grid can vary from 1 to 10,000.

Random color change and gradual transparency value change functions are implemented.

It is also possible to create a new grid.

A solution was provided for situations in which the user enters an incorrect value to create a new grid. Several checks are performed: for the type, for the number to match the range, and for cancelling the input.

The project was implemented as part of the 'Foundation' course from The Odin Project.
